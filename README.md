# Vib'N

Vib'N is an app that allows users to practice holding musical notes and track their progress over multiple sessions. Users can compete with each other to see who can hold notes the longest.

## Note

This is just something I am playing with, still alot of work to be done, so take it as it is with all its defects (I have just been putting in some test frequencies).

## Features

- **Voice Input**: Detect and display the pitch of the user's voice in real-time.
- **Session Tracking**: Track multiple sessions to observe improvement over time.
- **Competition Mode**: Users can compete to see who can hold notes the longest.
- **Pitch Visualization**: Visualize pitches with bars and a pitch needle.
- **Session Statistics**: View detailed statistics for each session.

*Note: The **Upload Song** feature is currently under development.*
